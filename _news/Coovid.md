A letter to our partners concerning the COVID-19 Pandemic. 

<!--more-->
As I am sure all of you are aware, the industry is dealing with a significant disruption caused by the outbreak of COVID-19, the Coronavirus. As a valuable partner, we wanted to reach out to you and provide additional information on how to best protect yourself and maintain a healthy working environment. Your safety, and the safety of those whose homes we are inspecting, is of the utmost concern to us. We have provided a few best practices and additional information for your benefit:

Best Practices to Maintaining a Healthy Work Environment:

• Wash hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer before and after every inspection

• Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze – if you have a tissue available, use that; if you don’t have one, cough or sneeze in the bend of your elbow, NOT your hands. Wash your hands immediately with soap and water after you cough or sneeze. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands

• Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever and cough

• Politely decline to shake hands and consider social distancing whenever possible

• Regularly clean and disinfect areas that are frequently touched. Germs love surfaces such as desktops, tables, cell phones, counters, door handles and office equipment. You can use disinfectant wipes on your desktop keyboard and mouse, but do NOT use wipes on your computer screens or laptops

Over the last couple of weeks, as part of our objective to responsibly achieve social distancing for the safety of employees and our communities, we have restricted all domestic and international travel and implemented  a companywide virtual work from home model for all of our employees as instructed in our business continuity plan. 
 
Our team will communicate with you on any updates or changes that may be necessary. In the meantime, please do not hesitate to reach out to your eMerge contacts, if you have any questions or concerns.

Additionally, if you need an authorization letter to confirm Essential Business,  please reach out to our compliance team at info@emergepropertysolutions.com. 

Lastly, while this is a challenge that we have never faced before, I remain confident that by working together with our vendors and business partners, we will successfully navigate this global crisis and emerge stronger than ever.
 
Wishing good health to you and your family.
